Displaying alternate forms on a detailed card view can be handled by creating a section within the card dedicated to showcasing these forms. Each form can be displayed as a list item, and possibly, you could show a small thumbnail image of each form next to its name. Here's a way you might structure the HTML to include a section for alternate forms:

1. **Creating a Section for Alternate Forms:**
```html
<div class="pokemon-forms">
    <h3>Alternate Forms</h3>
    <ul id="alternate-forms-list">
        <!-- Form items will be populated here -->
    </ul>
</div>
```

2. **Populating the Alternate Forms Section:**
```javascript
function displayAlternateForms(forms) {
    const formsList = document.getElementById('alternate-forms-list');
    formsList.innerHTML = '';  // Clear any existing form items
    
    forms.forEach(form => {
        const listItem = document.createElement('li');
        listItem.innerHTML = `
            <img src="path_to_images/${form.formName}.png" alt="${form.displayName}">
            <span>${form.displayName}</span>
        `;
        formsList.appendChild(listItem);
    });
}
```

In the `displayAlternateForms` function:

- We first clear any existing items in the `alternate-forms-list` element.
- We then loop through the `forms` array, creating a new list item (`li`) element for each form.
- Each list item contains an image and a span element to show the form's name. The `src` attribute of the `img` element assumes that you have images for each form saved with filenames matching the `formName` property of each form object, and all stored in a directory named `path_to_images`. The `alt` attribute provides alternative text describing the image, which is useful for accessibility.

When you have the detailed information of a Pok√©mon, you can call `displayAlternateForms(pokemon.forms)` to populate the alternate forms section.
